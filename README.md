# Searches-using-several-AI-Algorithms
In Artificial Intelligence, Search techniques are universal problem-solving methods. Rational agents or Problem-solving agents in AI mostly used these search strategies or algorithms to solve a specific problem and provide the best result. Problem-solving agents are the goal-based agents and use atomic representation.

Searching problems can be solved using trees and graphs and to be be specific, trees and graphs works differently. For graphs, they are considered to be more accurate in searches but they can either be directed or undirected. Directed means that they contain a specific direction for the search flow whereas undirected does not have any direction which means the graph can go either way.

Generally, searches are of two types; the uninformed search (blind search) and the informed search. These searches works differently depending on the method chosen like blind search with Breadth-first search will work differently as compared to informed search with Depth-first search. Uninformed search will take a bit more time to reach to the goal node compared to the informed search as it takes a fairly lesser time but if we have opted for A* algorithm then we cannot say much on the time taken as these methods involves weights of the edge and the heuristics associated with them so time can vary.

There are two categories for graphs to be drawn:
•	The Directed Search
•	The Undirected Search  

The two kinds of searches are as follows:
•	The Informed Search
•	The Uninformed Search (Blind Search)  

Search techniques inside uninformed search are:
•	Breadth-First Search
•	Depth-First Search
•	Depth Limit Search
•	Iterative Deepening Search
•	Uniform Cost Search




Search techniques inside informed search are:
•	Greedy Search
•	A* Search
